Grist Omnibus
=============

This is an experimental way to install Grist on a server
quickly with authentication and certificate handling set up
out of the box.

So you and your colleagues can log in:

And use Grist without fuss:

It bundles:

 * Grist itself from [grist-core](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/) -
   Grist is a handy spreadsheet / online database app,
   presumably you like it and that's why you are here.
 * A reverse proxy, [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) -
   we use this to coordinate with Let's Encrypt to get a
   certificate for https traffic.
 * An identity service, [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/) -
   this can connect to LDAP servers, SAML providers, Google,
   Microsoft, etc, and also (somewhat reluctantly) supports
   hard-coded user/passwords that can be handy for a quick
   fuss-free test.
 * An authentication middleware, [traefik-forward-auth](https://github.com/thomseddon/traefik-forward-auth) to
   connect Grist and Dex via Traefik.

Here's the minimal configuration you need to provide.
 * `EMAIL`: an email address, used for Let's Encrypt and for
   initial login.
 * `PASSWORD`: optional - if you set this, you'll be able to
   log in without configuring any other authentication
   settings. You can add more accounts as `EMAIL2`,
   `PASSWORD2`, `EMAIL3`, `PASSWORD3` etc.
 * `TEAM` - a short lowercase identifier, such as a company or project name
   (`grist-labs`, `cool-beans`). Just `a-z`, `0-9` and
   `-` characters please.
 * `URL` - this is important, you need to provide the base
   URL at which Grist will be accessed. It could be something
   like `https://grist.example.com`, or `http://localhost:9999`.
   No path element please.
 * `HTTPS` - mandatory if `URL` is `https` protocol. Can be
   `auto` (Let's Encrypt) if Grist is publically accessible and
   you're cool with automatically getting a certificate from
   Let's Encrypt. Otherwise use `external` if you are dealing
   with ssl termination yourself after all, or `manual` if you want
   to provide a certificate you've prepared yourself (there's an
   example below).

The minimal storage needed is an empty directory mounted
at `/persist`.

So here is a complete docker invocation that would work on a public
instance with ports 80 and 443 available:
```
mkdir -p /tmp/grist-test
docker run \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -e URL=https://cool-beans.example.com \
  -e HTTPS=auto \
  -e TEAM=cool-beans \
  -e EMAIL=owner@example.com \
  -e PASSWORD=topsecret \
  -v /tmp/grist-test:/persist \
  --name grist --rm \
  -it gristlabs/grist-omnibus  # or grist-ee-omnibus for enterprise
```

And here is an invocation on localhost port 9999 - the only
differences are the `-p` port configuration and the `-e URL=` environment
variable.
```
mkdir -p /tmp/grist-test
docker run \
  -p 9999:80 \
  -e URL=http://localhost:9999 \
  -e TEAM=cool-beans \
  -e EMAIL=owner@example.com \
  -e PASSWORD=topsecret \
  -v /tmp/grist-test:/persist \
  --name grist --rm \
  -it gristlabs/grist-omnibus  # or grist-ee-omnibus for enterprise
```

If providing your own certificate (`HTTPS=manual`), provide a
private key and certificate file as `/custom/grist.key` and
`custom/grist.crt` respectively:

```
docker run \
  ...
  -e HTTPS=manual \
  -v $(PWD)/key.pem:/custom/grist.key \
  -v $(PWD)/cert.pem:/custom/grist.crt \
  ...
```

Remember if you are on a public server you don't need to do this, you can
set `HTTPS=auto` and have Traefik + Let's Encrypt do the work for you.

If you run the omnibus behind a separate reverse proxy that terminates SSL, then you should
`HTTPS=external`, and set an additional environment variable `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` to the IP
address or IP range of the proxy. This may be a comma-separated list, e.g.
`127.0.0.1/32,192.168.1.7`. See Traefik's [forwarded
headers](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/entrypoints/#forwarded-headers).

You can change `dex.yaml` (for example, to fill in keys for Google
and Microsoft sign-ins, or to remove them) and then either rebuild
the image or (easier) make the custom settings available to the omnibus
as `/custom/dex.yaml`:

```
docker run \
  ...
  -v $PWD/dex.yaml:/custom/dex.yaml \
  ...
```

You can tell it is being used because `Using /custom/dex.yaml` will
be printed instead of `No /custom/dex.yaml`.
